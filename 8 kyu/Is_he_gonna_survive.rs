Is he gonna survive?

A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission.
However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated,
our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. 
Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)
